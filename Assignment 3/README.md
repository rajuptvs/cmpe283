# Assignment 3: Instrumentation Via Hyper-call (Add New CPUID Emulation Features in KVM)</br>
Screenshots :

- Instructions
 - Continue from the previous environment used for the Assignment 2 
 - Modify the cpuid.c, vmx.c and cpuid.h as per the requirement and SDM 
 - Once Modified, Use the similar steps used in assignment 2, to rebuild the kernel 
 - Once Kernel is built do a reboot and launch the inner vm and run the test cases from inside. 
 Output should be somewhat like the below
