# Assignment 3: Instrumentation Via Hyper-call (Add New CPUID Emulation Features in KVM)</br>
Screenshots :

- Instructions
 - Continue from the previous environment used for the Assignment 2 
 - Modify the cpuid.c, vmx.c and cpuid.h as per the requirement and SDM 
 - Once Modified, Use the similar steps used in assignment 2, to rebuild the kernel 
 - Once Kernel is built do a reboot and launch the inner vm and run the test cases from inside. 
 Output should be somewhat like the below

A3 Questions:

* Does the number of exits increase at a stable rate?
  * No, certain exits grow, while others stay the same. The ones that rise have varying increment ratios depending on the kind of exit.

* Are there more exits performed during certain VM operations?
  * Yes the exits are more for certain VM operations like  EXIT_REASON_MSR_READ(31), EXIT_REASON_IO_INSTRUCTION(30),  EXIT_REASON_CPUID(10) etc.

* Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
    * It contains approximately 833121 exits with total 12385262220 cycle times.
    
* Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?
  * The most common exit reason is EXIT REASON EPT VIOLATION(48), while the least common exit reason is EXIT REASON DR ACCESS(29).
  * Additionally, the biggest increment over time is for EXIT REASON MSR READ(31), whereas the lowest increment is for EXIT REASON EPT VIOLATION(48).
